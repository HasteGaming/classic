# Raiding with <Haste>
	
Our mission is to put a quality raid together under the unified tag of <Haste>. The expectation is that we all contribute in our best capacity. No more. No less. 
	
		- Roles: Each role is to be promoted with an Assist or (A) before raid kickoff.

			- Raid Runner: This person is our 'conductor'. It rolls up to this individual.
			- Class Champions: Each group has a seat at our table. These individuals are responsible for coordinating their groups with the larger group.
			- Tanking: Work with the pull team & raid runner to correctly execute position for our raid.
			- DPS: 
				- Kill it. Don't die.
				- Dead dps = bad. Not a tank problem.
			- Pull Team: Hunters , Warlocks, Druids, Mages, Warriors, Priest. Do your job on the pull. Communicate with those around you. The pull only starts with the first shot, and finishes when we're drinking.

		- Required Addon(s):
			- Deadly Boss Mods (DBM)
				- Don't stand in the fire dummy! JK, but srsly.
				
			- Classic Loot Assist
				- Loot the dog. Thank you. 
				
			- RC_LootCouncil (+ EPGP)
				- Required for loot participation & distribution. 
			
			- Optional (but strongly recommended):

					- Our common scheduling tool to share and coordinate off schedule content.
				- CEPGP
					- This allows easy visibility into backing EP/GP system.
				
	
		- Loot
			- Progression Loot Distribution is Loot council driven by analytics.
			- The primary goal of the loot council is to distribute loot in an evenly and fair. Typically this means the group has 75% agreement or more.
			- The council is made up of voted peers. These individuals will have the rank of Class Champion, and will have access to officer chat.
			- Champions “elections” will happen quarterly/content patch if vacant.
			- Loot from any instance is not to be 'Need' rolled & sold to another <Haste> member.
				- Items won via the "Greed" roll can be traded/sold.
	
				
		
		- Combat:
			- Communications
				- Voice channels are to be cleared within 3 trash packs of a boss to enable respectful coordination prior to boss engagement. 
				
			- Strategy
				- Do your job. Don't know what to do? Ask.
			
			- Staying alive
				- Dead people don't DPS. 
				
			- Default Kill Order:
				- Skull
