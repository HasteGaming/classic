## Foreward

Hello.

Thank you for taking the time to read this document, or to explore gaming with Haste.

The goal of this document is to outline expectations from the guild and it's members. This is a living document which will be updated over time to reflect the current state. The goal of this document is to outline who we are and are not. Moreover, we should not be confined to what is explicitly stated within this document when it comes to ethics, teamwork, and respect with each other.

## Our mission

Our mission is to put a quality raid together under the unified tag of Haste. The expectation is that we all contribute in our best capacity. No more. No less.

We're not multiple teams under one group. We're one group of people. No "A" team or "B" team. We look to make full use of our scheduled time to maximize production of loot. If we finish all content early in the schedule, our next goal is "split runs" with a tilt towards building the perfect raid.

- We're a progression gaming group which leans toward hardcore.
- We like to have fun. This often means exploring various aspects of the human condition together through colorful conversation.
- We tend to use loot council with analytics.
- A core tenant of our system is to reward individuals who have dedicated themselves to those around them.
- Event/Raid timing
  - Tuesday through Thursday 6:30pm - 10:00pm PST
  - We'll do our best to schedule events within this window.
  - We'll do our best to keep events within this window.

## Individual expectations

- Respect each other.
  - This means time, space, and effort.
  - Zero exceptions.
- Come prepared to raid.  
  - This means your character, your physical and mental wellbeing.
  - Check any attitude upon game login. See respect each others time.
- Bring your best self.
- Be ready to grow. No self limits.
- No cheats, exploits, or scams.
- Keep dividing politics at home.
- Have fun. It’s a game.

### Loot

Progression Loot Distribution is Loot council driven by analytics. Smaller raids such as Zul'Gurub are done with Need over Greed, and EPGP for Idols.

Loot from any instance is not to be 'Need' rolled, and then sold to another Haste member.
  > Exception: Items won via the "Greed" roll may be traded or sold.
  
#### Universal loot expectations
  
- No enchants? No priority.
  > Exception: Head & Leg enchants do not exclude

#### Loot Council

The council is made up of many individuals within the guild. It's a cross section of all layers within the guild by design to ensure that all members have the ability to be involved & ensure integrity & fairness to all.

- The primary goal of the loot council is to distribute loot in an even and fair manner.
  - Typically this means the group has 80% agreement or more from the selected comittee.
- The council is not static
- The council is made up of individuals from the rank of Class Champion, Officers, Raiders, and GM roles.
- The active council will have access to 'officer' chat to discuss item distribution.
- The council will be adjusted to ensure healthy voting numbers.
- Votes not resulting in a clear winner will have ties broken by elevating to the highest rank available for executive decision.
- Champions “elections” will happen near quarterly/content patch if vacant.

|Things we consider   |  Questions we ask  | Why?
|---|---|---|
| Recently acquired gear |  Have they made recent improvements? When was thier last upgrade?   | It displays work in and out of the raid |
| Raid prep | Have they taken the time to prepare their character? | Explore the range of their prep. Prep is many things. |
| Raid impact | Can this item impact the raid? | We always want to measure impact |
| Raid participation | Does this person contribute to the actively contribute to the raid? | It's always nice when people take initiative. |
| Raid performance | Does this person kick butt? | A primary objective, slay monsters! |
| Raid attitude | Does this person make raiding a pleasure? Or are they a fuck face? | Self-explanatory |
| Tenure | What does history say? | Time is a great measure of an individual's character. |
| Meeting expectations | Did they read this document? | Sometimes it's the basics |

##### Council Commitment

As mentioned above, the council is a cross section of the guild. The goal is that diversity provides perspective to create a fair process for deciding the most optimal placement of loot within the guild.

By voting on the council, each member is committed to a fair and quality vote for all participants.

##### Council Feedback

So something didn't go your way, or would like some clarity on something? Let's discuss AFTER the raid.

The feedback channels are to use **Class Champions**, **Officers**, and potentially the **GM**. Moreover, it's important to start local within our group & gain perspective.

### PUG'ing with Haste

Occasionally, we'll need to fill from the outside world. When we do so, we look to continue to embrace the quality standards which we expect from any raid. We've learned that we should baseline a few rules to ensure we've covered bases.

Our "house" rules will be covered verbally prior to raid start. If no objection is made, these rules are binding to the raid & the individuals until completion.

Rules (unless stated otherwise):

1. Main spec over off spec;
   > Gear should go to the respective archetype. However, users are not subect to all available gear. Caster gear is caster gear. 

2. Rolled loot is +1;
    > You cannot win two items until each person from the available rolls has collected an item.

3. Any rolling before an official 'greed roll' is considered usage of +1;
    > Also known as the "Promi" rule.

4. Materials;
   > Materials include all dungeon specific resources unless explicitly stated in this document.

5. Legendary items;
   > Legendary items on standing reserve include Eye of Sulfuras, Binding(s) of the Windseeker, Splinter of Atiesh.

### Upcoming additions

- EPGP introduction to non progression raids.
- Main/Alt expanded clarity.
